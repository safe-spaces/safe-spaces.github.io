    <p class="text">Having a safe space, an escape from everyday life or reality itself, should be a given. Quarantine has forced us inside, for the most-part, temporarily removing many of us from society. A home does not always feel like a home, and in the same way a bird builds a nest in a tree, it is important to find that singular spot where one can breathe – after all, feeling trapped can be suffocating.

      <br><br>Unfortunately, safe spaces are not a given. They are a luxury, a privilege. Those of us lucky enough to have the privacy and the room must take advantage of our ability to switch off and unwind. In the process of fitting this project together, I met a young man sleeping rough. Curly – a nickname of his – described his struggle to find a spot to sleep where he was not under threat of being attacked or mugged. I sat and listened as he explained that, “If [he was] to look in a mirror, [he] would see nothing, nothing at all.” Losing one’s sense of place can strip one’s sense of self. The spaces we build are an extension of ourselves and give us the opportunity to expand and grow. 
      
      <br><br>The term ‘safe space’ has become a point of satire for some; one might imagine it spoken in the condescending tone of a counsellor or a supercilious family member. In order to obtain a true sense of security, you have to construct it yourself. Having a spot that is entirely your own can motivate new thought, inspiration, perhaps some self reflection. We are in strange times indeed, and so if you are lucky enough to find the silver lining to your isolation, don’t forget to take advantage of it.
      
      <br><br>I would like to extend a huge thanks to everyone who participated in this project. In contributing your interpretation of a safe space, you have enabled me to piece this work together. At first, I found it frustrating how many people seemed to ignore the specifics of the brief; however, the outcomes ended up making the body of images much more diverse as a whole – safe spaces can be discovered and kept as they are, they can be existing spaces or something constructed from scratch. They can be fleeting or permanent, indoors or outdoors. Whether they are found or invented, for many of us, dens and forts are our earliest memories of independent existence.
      
     <br> <br>Message me on Instagram if you have any thoughts or questions, I would love to hear any of your responses! And remember, this is a safe space… ;)
